      <p align="left">Grandchildren given £50 each from 'hurt' grandfather's £500k fortune  ordered to pay £220k costs A High Court Judge ruled that the will had been made  on rational grounds.<br />      
      </p>
      <p align="left">When dealing with a recently deceased loved one's will, there can often be  tension amongst families.Ideally, a will should allow you to outline your wishes and avoid any  conflict between relatives as cash and assets are divided up. However this is not always the case, with families often coming to blows  over the amount they have (or haven't) received from a loved one.This is what happened with Fredrick Ward Sr's family after his death, with  the former soldier's will seeing the family end up in court in 2020.<br />
      </p>
      <p align="left">Following his passing, the family was left to divide his £500,000 fortune -  and Fred Sr had left clear instructions on how the money was to be divided. Disappointed that five of his grandchildren, the daughters of his son Fred  Jr, hadn't visited him in his last few years, the 91-year-old would leave them  just £50 each. While his other children, Terry Ward and Susan Wiltshire,  inherited the majority of his fortune and £450,000 flat.<br />
      </p>
      <p align="left">After learning of the news five granddaughters - Carol Gowing, Angela St  Marseille, Amanda Higginbotham, Christine Ward and Janet Pett - took the will  to court. The sisters' claimed  they should have been allowed to inherit their late father's share of the  money, as well as accusing their aunt and uncle of having 'unduly influenced'  their granddad into changing the will. However High Court  judge, Master James Brightwell ultimately ruled in favour of the will - written  in 2018 - stating that it  has been based on rational grounds.<br />
        <br />
The court outlined that the rational grounds were the granddaughters not  visiting him. Following the hearing, the five sisters have now been ordered to pay  £220,000-plus bill to cover their legal fees as well as the costs incurred by  their aunt and uncle defending the claim. The sisters have been asked to pay £100,000 up front towards the bill, with  the estimating to be around £136,470 minus VAT.This is on top of their legal costs of £85,688.50. </p>      
      <p align="left">During the case least year, the judge heard that Fred Sr had previously  drafted a will which shared his estate equally between all three of his  children. However after the death of Fred Jr - father to the five daughters - the  family had become estranged, with the sisters not seeing much of their  grandfather. The contents of the will led to a shouting match between the family, which  had been played out to the court. Ruling on the case, Master Brightwell concluded: &quot;In those  circumstances, and despite a promise by Fred several years earlier to divide  his estate between his children's children if anything should happen to any of  them, the 2018 will was in my view entirely rational. <br />
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This does not mean that I cannot understand the claimants'  disappointment at being essentially left out.&quot; Even while you're six feet under. A disappointed grandfather gave his grandkids the  ultimate snub by leaving them only £50 each. That might be all he could spare, you might think. Oh no, he had a £500,000  fortune. Fredrick Ward Sr threw his family into a major row after his death in  2020. While his son Terry Ward and Susan Wiltshire got most of his fortune and  his £450,000 flat, his dead son Fred Jr's kids got nothing. Why did they get  left the square root of squat? Apparently, the 91-year-old had told his lawyers  that he was upset they hadn't visited him when he was hospitalised three times  with a lung condition.<br />
      </p>
      <p align="left">When the grandkids discovered they had been left out, they weren't happy. Carol  Growing, Angela St Marseille, Amanda Higginbotham, Christine Ward and Janet  Pett teamed up to sue. But a High Court judge, Master James Brightwell, ruled  that Ward's will, written in 2018, was based on rational grounds.These rational  grounds being that they had limited contact with him in his final years. <span class="style1"></span>As he threw out their case, Master Brightwell remarked: &quot;Some may take  the view that, as a general proposition, when a testator's child has  predeceased him, he generally ought to leave an equal share of his residue to  that child's issue. &quot;However, the decision not to do so and to split the  residue and thus the bulk of the estate between his surviving children can  hardly be said to be provision which no reasonable testator could make.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The sisters claimed that their aunt and uncle had 'unduly influenced' Ward  into giving them more of the estate. A recording of Ward's will reading was  played to the court - which showed the moment the family got embroiled in a  huge shouting match.</p>      
      <p align="left">Master Brightwell concluded: &quot;In those circumstances, and despite a  promise by Fred several years earlier to divide his estate between his  children's children if anything should happen to any of them, the 2018 will was  in my view entirely rational. &quot;This does not mean that I cannot understand the claimants'  disappointment at being essentially left out.&quot;</p>
